# Robot-Navigation
This project is a navigation system for SABiR surgery robot.
It contains two parts: Tracking and Planning.
In tracking part we track the robot needle and target. The tracking algorithm is based on particle filter.
In planning part we have path planning and motion planning. The planning algorithm is based on potential fields.
This project is cooperated with Mark Renfrew.
